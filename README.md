## Try it now

Try the GPT-4 powered PR-Insight instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@KhulnaSoft-Insight` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The insight will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:
```
@KhulnaSoft-Insight /review
```
and the insight will respond with a review of your PR.

Note that this is a promotional bot, suitable only for initial experimentation.
It does not have 'edit' access to your repo, for example, so it cannot update the PR description or add labels (`@KhulnaSoft-Insight /describe` will publish PR description as a comment). In addition, the bot cannot be used on private repositories, as it does not have access to the files there.


![Review generation process](https://www.khulnasoft.com/images/demo-2.gif)


To set up your own PR-Insight, see the [Installation](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/installation/) section below.
Note that when you set your own PR-Insight or use KhulnaSoft hosted PR-Insight, there is no need to mention `@KhulnaSoft-Insight ...`. Instead, directly start with the command, e.g., `/ask ...`.

Check out the [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) page for more details on how we convert a code diff to a manageable LLM prompt

## Why use PR-Insight?

A reasonable question that can be asked is: `"Why use PR-Insight? What makes it stand out from existing tools?"`

Here are some advantages of PR-Insight:

- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single GPT-4 call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.
- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.
- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the '/review' tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_insight/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.
- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Action, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama2).


## Data privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Insight

- If you host PR-Insight with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

### KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro 💎

- When using PR-Insight Pro 💎, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro will use KhulnaSoft’s proprietary models — if this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests’ data — PR-Insight will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

### PR-Insight Chrome extension

- The [PR-Insight Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-insight-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Insight tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Insight.
