## Self-hosted PR-Insight

- If you self-host PR-Insight with your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) API key, it is between you and the provider. We don't send your code data to PR-Insight servers.

## PR-Insight Pro 💎

- When using PR-Insight Pro 💎, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro will use KhulnaSoft’s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests’ data — PR-Insight will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## PR-Insight Chrome extension

- The [PR-Insight Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-insight-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) will not send your code to any external servers.
